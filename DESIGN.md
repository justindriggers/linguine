# Wisps and the Wails

## Overview

Healing-focused game where players must overcome uniquely challenging encounters using a party of up to 5 "wisps", each with their own attributes and characteristics.

## Target Platform

PC (Steam)

## Target Audience

MMORPG players who are familiar with healing-centric gameplay

## Gameplay

- The player starts the game by selecting one of three wisps.
- Each wisp has its own passive offensive capabilities, and provides the player with an active ability.
- A wisp's offensive power is proportional to its current health level. If a wisp reaches 0 health, then it may no longer attack.
- The game is separated into several "worlds", each containing various "levels".
- Each world contains a specific theme, and every level within a world explores that world's theme.
- The player must complete each level by defeating the Wail of that level. Each Wail encounter is unique, and the player must execute the mechanics of the encounter while keeping the party healthy using active abilities.
- Completing a level rewards the player with a random wisp. If the player already has 5 wisps in the party, then an existing wisp may be replaced, or the new wisp may be passed.
